# Backend Reality Remediation Register

This register gives every capability from the 2026-08-11 Backend Reality
Matrix a permanent identifier. A finding cannot disappear because source code
was added; its state changes only when the evidence tier in
`docs/testing/R002_MIGRATION_ACCEPTANCE.md` or a later phase-specific contract
has passed.

## Status vocabulary

- `PROTECTED`: supplied R001 acceptance or executable evidence currently
  supports classification A; regression protection is required.
- `OPEN`: no authorized implementation is active.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: inside the currently authorized phase.
- `IMPLEMENTED`: code exists but repository verification is incomplete.
- `REPOSITORY_VERIFIED`: local/static/integration evidence passed.
- `STAGING_VERIFIED`: Supabase staging acceptance passed.
- `LIVE_ACCEPTED`: authorized live acceptance passed.
- `BLOCKED`: a named external or predecessor gate prevents progression.

## Baseline distribution

| Class | Count | Percentage |
|---|---:|---:|
| A — Fully operational | 9 | 12.86% |
| B — Partially connected | 20 | 28.57% |
| C — Locally simulated | 13 | 18.57% |
| D — Missing | 11 | 15.71% |
| E — Unsafe for production | 17 | 24.29% |

The distribution is updated only after a phase gate closes. Phase 1 cannot
promote a capability to A because it does not include Supabase staging/live
acceptance.
