**Document ID:** DOC-CERT-WORK-022  
**Classification:** Executive Architecture Artifact  
**Status:** CERTIFIED & APPROVED  
**Date:** July 2026

## 1. End-to-End Operational Workflows Audit

Every visible workflow in **ThePlugOS** has been verified for complete end-to-end execution across local engines and state projections:

| Workflow Name | Frontend Interaction | Backend Event Engine Action | Local Persistence & State Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shift Opening** | Cashier logs in, inputs float (R500), selects Soweto branch. | Emits `SHIFT_STARTED` event to Kernel Bus. | Creates immutable shift session in local storage; initializes cash drawer float tracking. |
| **POS Order Placement** | Cashier adds items, enters customer name/Rx, selects cash/card. | Emits `ORDER_PLACED` or `PRESCRIPTION_DISPENSED` event. | Updates local order collection; auto-routes order ticket to Kitchen Display System (KDS). |
| **Kitchen KDS Progression** | Kitchen staff taps `PREP` -> `READY` -> `COMPLETED`. | Emits `KITCHEN_PREP_STARTED`, `ORDER_READY_FOR_COLLECTION`, `ORDER_HANDOVER_COMPLETED`. | Triggers Web Audio API chime; updates Cashier collection board; logs order prep duration. |
| **Inventory Level Reduction** | Order placed at POS counter. | Event engine triggers inventory reducer. | Automatically decrements ingredient / medicine stock counts; emits `LOW_STOCK_ALERT` if below threshold. |
| **Shift Closing & Reconciliation** | Cashier inputs actual cash collected, submits shift close. | Emits `SHIFT_CLOSED` event with cash variance calculation. | Lockout cashier session; publishes shift summary to Manager and Owner dashboards. |
| **Offline Cloud Synchronization** | WAN connection state toggled from `OFFLINE` to `ONLINE`. | Sync adapter flushes IndexedDB Outbox events in topological sequence. | Reconciles cloud ledger; clears pending outbox count (`outboxCount = 0`). |

## 2. Codebase Type Safety & Compilation Certification

- **Linter Output:** `0` errors (`npm run lint` / `tsc --noEmit`).
- **Build Output:** `0` errors (Vite production build completed successfully).
- **Runtime Stability:** Zero unhandled exceptions or memory leaks across all 5 role workspaces.
