## 1. Identified Defects & Remediation Log

During the destructive reality validation phase of **Executive Engineering Directive 012**, all system behaviors were audited against constitutional mandates. Every identified gap was immediately remediated and re-verified.

| Item ID | Component | Discovered Issue / Weakness | Root Cause Analysis | Remediation Applied | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DEF-01** | **Receipt Service** | Print action previously relied on browser default print dialog without fallback options. | Single print path assumption. | Replaced with complete Multi-Channel Receipt Engine (WhatsApp direct share, Web Share API, TXT/PDF file save, Clipboard copy, and 15% SA VAT compliance). | **RESOLVED & CERTIFIED** |
| **DEF-02** | **Device Pairing** | Device discovery lacked visual non-technical QR pairing wizard for township operators. | Technical terminology in hub inspector modal. | Created `DevicePairingWizard.tsx` providing single-tap QR code scanning, branch certificate exchange, and non-technical language. | **RESOLVED & CERTIFIED** |
| **DEF-03** | **Kitchen Notifications** | Kitchen ticket status transition to `READY` lacked local audio/visual feedback. | Silent event dispatch in local state handler. | Integrated Web Audio API sine wave notification chime (A5->D6 tone generator) and cashier collection board flash. | **RESOLVED & CERTIFIED** |
| **DEF-04** | **Owner Network View** | Owner workspace displayed technical network metrics ("IP", "Port", "WebSocket"). | Developer-centric header component. | Updated `OwnerWorkspace.tsx` and `RoleHeader.tsx` to display plain-language status (*"Business Network: Healthy & Connected - 4 Devices"*). | **RESOLVED & CERTIFIED** |
