## 1. Ergonomic & First-Time Operator Certification

ThePlugOS is engineered for township operators who may have varying levels of digital literacy. In accordance with Directive 010, every screen and interactive flow was audited against strict human experience criteria:

1. **Obvious & Natural Interaction:** Screen designs remove tech jargon (e.g. replaced "API Endpoint" with "Branch Hub Status").
2. **Minimal Tap Count:** Primary actions (e.g., adding a item to cart, taking cash, moving kitchen ticket to `PREP`) are completed in 1 to 2 taps.
3. **High Contrast & Touch Target Sizing:** All touch targets are minimum 44px with high-contrast slate-900 background and clear text.
