# Executive Engineering Directive 009: Local Hub Runtime Specification

**Document ID:** DOC-CERT-HUB-012  
**Classification:** Executive Architecture Artifact  
**Status:** CERTIFIED & APPROVED  
**Date:** July 2026  

---

## 1. Architectural Purpose

The **Local Hub Runtime** serves as the local authority for all operational nodes within a physical branch (Cashier POS Terminals, Kitchen Display Systems, Supervisor Tablets, and Executive Devices). It removes single points of cloud failure by executing all core platform engines directly on local branch hardware.

## 3. Core Engine Responsibilities

1. **Embedded Local HTTP & WebSocket Server:** Handles instant inter-device RPCs and live event broadcasting across local LAN clients with sub-5ms latency.
2. **Local Event Ledger:** Appends all operational actions (`ORDER_PLACED`, `KITCHEN_PREP_STARTED`, `PRESCRIPTION_DISPENSED`) to an immutable local event log prior to cloud sync.
3. **CQRS Projection Engine:** Maintains read-optimized in-memory state snapshots for order boards, stock balances, and shift totals so queries remain sub-millisecond.
4. **Outbox & Inbox Queue Manager:** Ensures guaranteed at-least-once local event delivery across local peers and eventual consistent cloud replication.

---

## 4. Operational Guarantees

- **Zero Cloud Latency:** All cashier payment processing and kitchen ticket generation occur locally.
- **Durable Local Persistence:** Transactions are committed to IndexedDB / local flash storage before network transmission.
- **Automatic Master Election:** If the primary Cashier Hub tablet shuts down, the secondary Manager tablet automatically assumes Local Hub Authority.
