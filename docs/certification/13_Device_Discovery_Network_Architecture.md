## 1. Zero-Configuration Local LAN Discovery

To deploy ThePlugOS in township environments without IT engineers, the system implements automatic local network discovery using **mDNS (Multicast DNS)** and **UDP LAN Broadcasts**.

## 2. Local Device Security & Authentication

1. **Shared Branch Identity Certificate:** Every authorized terminal receives a cryptographically signed SHA-256 certificate during initial onboarding.
2. **Mutual TLS / Token Validation:** Connections lacking a valid branch certificate are automatically dropped by the Local Hub WebSocket gateway.
3. **Role-Based Permission Enforcement:** POS terminals are restricted to order creation and shift operations; only Supervisor terminals can authorize refunds or inventory adjustments.
4. **Device Revocation:** The Local Hub maintains a local Certificate Revocation List (CRL). If a tablet is lost or stolen, the manager can instantly revoke its access with one tap.
