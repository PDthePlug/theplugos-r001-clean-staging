# ThePlugOS

ThePlugOS is a local-first operating system for high-chaos small-business
operations. The first domain is township fast food.

## What this source currently provides

- An owner-authenticated browser shell for the R001 business foundation.
- A deliberately fail-closed Android-native Cashier Hub foundation: SQLCipher
  local ledger, Android Keystore device keys, signed authorization bundles,
  native PIN entry, durable outbox, and cloud-receiver source.
- Ordered R001/R002/R003 migration source and staging-only Edge Function
  source. These are not deployed.

The browser does **not** provide operational authority, staff PIN entry,
browser-to-browser LAN operation, payment settlement, or a live kitchen flow.
Those functions remain gated until the stated staging and physical-device
evidence exists.

## Local source checks

Use Node `22.22.2` and npm `11.9.0`:

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

The complete repository gate is available as `npm run test:all`. It includes
the R001/R002 source checks and native-Hub static contracts; it does not replace
Supabase staging, Deno deployment, Android build, or hardware acceptance.

## Android Cashier Hub

Use JDK 21 and Android SDK API 36:

```bash
npm run android:sync
npm run android:assemble:debug
```

The build has no default cloud endpoint or issuer key. Supply only staging or
production-approved public configuration through Gradle properties, never
browser variables or source control. See
[the Android build and security guide](docs/implementation/ANDROID_CASHIER_HUB_BUILD_AND_SECURITY.md).

## Database and release safety

The only deployment inputs are the ordered files in `supabase/migrations/` and
their corresponding preflight/validation scripts. Artifacts in
`supabase/quarantine/` are forensic reference only and must not be applied.

Do not run R002 or R003 on production. The required clean-staging sequence is
documented in
[the Hub-authority rehearsal](docs/implementation/STAGING_HUB_AUTHORITY_REHEARSAL.md).
